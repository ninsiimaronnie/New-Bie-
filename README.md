My first solo project to test my new HTML skills. Created a basic single-page website. Learned how to structure pages with semantic HTML tags and add simple styling.
Starting to showcase my work now that I understand HTML fundamentals. Included placeholder content and images while practicing layout techniques. A work in progress but proud of this first step!# New-Bie-
